This is a short overview of how to build
XCA for MAC OSX

Please drop me a mail if you experience problems..
There are 2 ways to compile XCA on MAC:

1) Simple local not very but a little portable build.
   Use the locally installed OpenSSL library

2) Use an up-to-date OpenSSL library 1.0.1 and build
   a 32 bit binary the should run even on "Leopard"
   This is what I do for the official XCA .dmg releases
   It is more complicated then 1)

Required tools for 1) and 2):
  a) XCODE
     Only the < 200MB "Command Line Tools for Xcode" are required
     to build XCA, not the complete 2GB Xcode binary.
  b) Qt Framework 4 (Qt 5 does not work with XCA, yet)
     For 1) install the qt-mac-carbon-opensource-4.x.y.dmg
     For 2) we need to compile Qt from source, see below

1) Simple local not very but a little portable build
   Run
      $ ./configure && make -j4
   which should result in an xca-1.x.y-<darwin>.dmg

2) More portable 32 bit app with an up-to-date OpenSSL
   Read below for using the misc/mac-build.sh script
   Define an installation directory
   export INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/src/install"

   a) Compile qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.x
      with the following command:
      ./configure -no-qt3support -no-xmlpatterns -no-multimedia -no-audio-backend -no-phonon -no-phonon-backend -no-svg -no-webkit -no-javascript-jit -no-script -no-scripttools -no-declarative -arch x86 -opensource -release -prefix $INSTALL_DIR/Qt485

   b) Compile OpenSSL 1.0.Xy

      # define the installation dir and the path to the new library
      # it will be installed locally in you home directory
      export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$INSTALL_DIR/lib

      # configure openssl
      ./config shared --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR

      # build and install OpenSSL
      make && make install

      # IMPORTANT: you need to change access type of the libs to be writable
      chmod 755 $OPENSSLINSTALLDIR/lib/*.dylib

   c) Compile ibtool-2.2.6b
      ./configure --prefix ${INSTALL_DIR} && make -j5 && make install

   d) Compile XCA:

      # configure XCA and build the DMG file
      export CXXFLAGS="-arch i386 -I${INSTALL_DIR}/include -L${INSTALL_DIR}/lib"
      ./configure --with-openssl="$INSTALL_DIR" --with-qt="$INSTALL_DIR/Qt485"
      make -j5 

      $XCA_DIR/configure --with-openssl="$INSTALL_DIR" --with-qt="$QTDIR"
      :make -sdd5 && make xca.dmg

    I do the steps b) - d) with the misc/build-mac.sh script
